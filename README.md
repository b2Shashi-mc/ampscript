## Getting Started

### Open the AMPscript Code Generator
To get started, the first thing you need to do is access the AMPscript code generator tool. Simply visit the tool’s website (https://b2shashi-mc.github.io/ampscript/), where you’ll find all the necessary files and instructions to start generating AMPscript code templates on demand.

### Enter the Number of Attributes and Click ‘Define Columns’
Once you’ve opened the AMPscript code generator, it’s time to configure your template. The tool allows you to define the number of columns you need for your dynamic content. This step is essential for ensuring that your AMPscript is tailored to your specific layout.
 #### Here’s how to do it:

- **Locate the Input Field for Columns**: On the page, you’ll see an input field where you can specify the number of columns you want in your template.
- **Enter the Desired Number**: Type the number of columns you need based on the layout of your email or marketing content. For example, if you need a three-column layout for a promotional email, simply enter “3”. Minimum attributes required is 3.
- **Click ‘Define Columns’**: After entering the number of columns, click the button labeled Define Columns. This action will trigger the generator to automatically adjust the structure and prepare the appropriate AMPscript template based on your input.

### Fill in the Column Details and Click ‘Generate Table’
Now that you’ve defined the number of columns, it’s time to fill in the details for each column in your AMPscript template. This step allows you to customize the content structure for each column in your layout, making your emails even more dynamic and tailored to your needs.

### Select the AMPscript Function from the Left Navigation to Generate the AMPscript Code Block
Now that your table structure is ready, it’s time to generate the AMPscript code block that will power your dynamic content. This step leverages the AMPscript functions, which are responsible for creating the logic behind your email’s personalized elements.

## Additional Features: Enhance Your Experience
In addition to the core functionality of generating AMPscript code templates, the tool offers several helpful features that make it even more user-friendly and customizable. Here’s a look at some of the key additional features:

### Toggle the Theme of the Webpage
For those who prefer a different visual experience, the tool allows you to toggle the theme of the webpage. Whether you like a light theme or a dark theme, you can easily switch between them based on your preference. This ensures that you can work in a comfortable environment for long hours, whether you’re building email templates or testing different AMPscript functions.

### Search for AMPscript Functions
If you’re unsure which AMPscript function you need, the tool includes a search box that makes it easy to find the right function quickly. Simply type in keywords like “lookup,” “if,” or “personalization,” and the search box will filter the available AMPscript functions for you. This saves you time and helps you locate the exact function you need for your template.

### Edit the Table Anytime
Sometimes, as you refine your email content, you may need to make adjustments to the structure of your table. The tool allows you to edit the table anytime during the process. You can go back, update the column details, or even add new columns to reflect the changes in your campaign. This flexibility ensures that your AMPscript code is always in sync with your design and content updates.
