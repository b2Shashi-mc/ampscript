## Getting Started

### Open the AMPscript Code Generator
To get started, the first thing you need to do is access the AMPscript code generator tool. Simply visit the tool’s website (https://b2shashi-mc.github.io/ampscript/), where you’ll find all the necessary files and instructions to start generating AMPscript code templates on demand.

### Enter the Number of Attributes and Click ‘Define Columns’
Once you’ve opened the AMPscript code generator, it’s time to configure your template. The tool allows you to define the number of columns you need for your dynamic content. This step is essential for ensuring that your AMPscript is tailored to your specific layout.
 #### Here’s how to do it:

- **Locate the Input Field for Columns**: On the page, you’ll see an input field where you can specify the number of columns you want in your template.
- **Enter the Desired Number**: Type the number of columns you need based on the layout of your email or marketing content. For example, if you need a three-column layout for a promotional email, simply enter “3”. Minimum attributes required is 3.
- **Click ‘Define Columns’**: After entering the number of columns, click the button labeled Define Columns. This action will trigger the generator to automatically adjust the structure and prepare the appropriate AMPscript template based on your input.

You can go back, update the column details, or even add new columns to reflect the changes in your campaign. This flexibility ensures that your AMPscript code is always in sync with your design and content updates.
